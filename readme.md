#Objective
#Build a simple website header.

#Instructions

1. Create a new GitHub repository and name it "Website Header".

2. Create a header for a website that includes a logo and a navigation menu. 
The header should have a height of 70 pixels.
The logo should be aligned to the left side of the header, and the navigation menu should be aligned to the right side of the header. 
The navigation menu should have four links: "Home", "About", "Services", and "Contact". 

3. When the user hovers over a link, the link should change color.

Hints:

Use an unordered list (ul) and list items (li) to create the navigation menu.
Use the :hover pseudo-class to change the color of the links when the user hovers over them.
